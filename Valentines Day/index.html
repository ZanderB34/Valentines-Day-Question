    <h1>I know that I havent given you one of my letters in a minute.</h1>
    <p>
      Roxy, 
      <br>
      There isn't much for me to say, I think (atleast I hope) you know how I feel towards you. But that's on the surface. Although it's impossible
      for me to truly tell you how I feel, I think I'd rather explain everything to you in both reminders and crappy metaphors (haha). I'll start with
      my mornings, because they hold so much more meaning than I say they do. Every morning, I wake up to my alarm clock, frantically check if I missed 
      any calls or texts from you and get up. In those moments between me getting up and checking my phone, I always wonder how in the world it takes 
      you atleast 10 alarms to wake up. On most days, periodically while I get ready for school, you'll text me the most random thing (usually misspelled),
      and then go back to bed until your real alarm wakes you up. It may not seem like much, but those texts mean the world to me; they give me subtle 
      remnants of your presence, reminding me that you're always with me. As I finally leave and get on the road, I'll think about how our life could be
      in the future. I watch the sunrise, with usually Tyler Childers, John Mayer, or Jack Johnson on the radio and think of you. Even though the sun 
      rises behind me. I still lose my gaze in seeing it happen in real time, day dreaming and fantasizing about our love. I think of the sunrise as 
      the start of something beautiful. The way it opens, greeting the rest of the world with its bright orange color, causes me to do nothing but be reminded of you. 
      As I listen to these songs and watch something so bright and gentle cast its light on the world, I'd usually get my first real goodmorning text from you. 
      While it may not seem much to your end, that text serves as a reminder for me that you are like the sun. Your bright and colorful personality lit up 
      my own night sky. Sometimes, in the fleeting moments where I can watch the sunrise in my rearview mirror, and feel the warmth caused by it on a cold January, I'd 
      break down for a minute. I'd shed tears not because of how pretty the sunrise is, I'd cry because it reminds me of you. It reminds me of us. I can't ever 
      escape your rays of sunshine, just as the Earth cannot escape the sun. You have me ensnared in your love, your warmth, and above all your gentleness. You 
      are like the sun, Roxy, and I'm reminded of it every single day. I cherish every moment we have together, no matter the situation. Because above all odds, every 
      morning, I'm shown both your sunrise and the sun's, and I cannot help but think that you two are interlinked. While I may be just a young kid in love, and our 
      future may not be 100% certain. I have this feeling that as long as I can witness the sunrise in the morning, I can also feel your own blossom of love 
      and light, because you and the sun must be the same. I love you.
